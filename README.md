Given a square matrix m[3×3], create a java code to calculate the value of its SECONDARY Diagonal See example belowHint: In order to better understand the concepts Involved in this exercises, research the terms “square matrix” and “secondary diagonal of a matrix” using your favourite search engine. Example given matrix m[3×3] shown below: 11 31 24 (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) 10 9 2 12 16 Secondary Diagonal (generic m[3×3] mt0,2) + mtl , 1) 4 mt2,01 Secondary Diagonal (as in the example above) 11 + 8 + 2 21 Note 1: Your java code MUST be GENERIC to calculate the secondary diagonal of ANY square matrix t2x2), etc. (Use a constant in your code to set the values of numberOfRows and numberOfColumns of your matrix_ Note 2: Your matrix m may be hardcoded (no need of user interaction) Note 3: In case numberOfRows and numberOfColumns ar differents, your program must display the following message: •This IS not a square matrix.”
